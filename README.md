# DPay  

**DPay** is a next-generation **Payment and Loyalty Platform**, serving as the core infrastructure for connecting customer experiences, optimizing business operations, and unlocking long-term data value.  

At its core, **DPay acts as a smart aggregator**:  
- Customers only need **one scan** to pay using any wallet or payment method.  
- The system automatically handles conversion, off-ramping into VND, and simultaneously triggers a smart contract to **mint transparent Loyalty Points on-chain**.

## Problem Today  

In multi-sector ecosystems, customers face major challenges:  

- **Fragmented Payments** – too many wallets, multiple channels, high conversion costs.  
- **Disjointed Loyalty** – points from airlines, banks, and hotels are siloed, hard to redeem, and often wasted.  

This results in **low engagement, low redemption rates**, and **missed cross-selling opportunities** for businesses.
